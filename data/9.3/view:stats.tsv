Name	Type	References	Description
schemaname	name	pg_namespace.nspname	Name of schema containing table
tablename	name	pg_class.relname	Name of table
attname	name	pg_attribute.attname	Name of the column described by this row
inherited	bool	 	If true, this row includes inheritance child columns, not just\nthe values in the specified table
null_frac	real	 	Fraction of column entries that are null
avg_width	integer	 	Average width in bytes of column's entries
n_distinct	real	 	If greater than zero, the estimated number of distinct values\nin the column. If less than zero, the negative of the number of distinct values divided by the number of rows. (The negated form is used when ANALYZE believes that the number of distinct values is likely to increase as the table grows; the positive form is used when the column seems to have a fixed number of possible values.) For example, -1 indicates a unique column in which the number of distinct values is the same as the number of rows.
most_common_vals	anyarray	 	A list of the most common values in the column. (Null if no\nvalues seem to be more common than any others.)
most_common_freqs	real[]	 	A list of the frequencies of the most common values, i.e.,\nnumber of occurrences of each divided by total number of rows. (Null when most_common_vals is.)
histogram_bounds	anyarray	 	A list of values that divide the column's values into groups of\napproximately equal population. The values in most_common_vals, if present, are omitted from this histogram calculation. (This column is null if the column data type does not have a < operator or if the most_common_vals list accounts for the entire population.)
correlation	real	 	Statistical correlation between physical row ordering and\nlogical ordering of the column values. This ranges from -1 to +1. When the value is near -1 or +1, an index scan on the column will be estimated to be cheaper than when it is near zero, due to reduction of random access to the disk. (This column is null if the column data type does not have a < operator.)
most_common_elems	anyarray	 	A list of non-null element values most often appearing within\nvalues of the column. (Null for scalar types.)
most_common_elem_freqs	real[]	 	A list of the frequencies of the most common element values,\ni.e., the fraction of rows containing at least one instance of the given value. Two or three additional values follow the per-element frequencies; these are the minimum and maximum of the preceding per-element frequencies, and optionally the frequency of null elements. (Null when most_common_elems is.)
elem_count_histogram	real[]	 	A histogram of the counts of distinct non-null element values\nwithin the values of the column, followed by the average number of distinct non-null elements. (Null for scalar types.)
