Name	Type	References	Description
oid	oid	 	Row identifier (hidden attribute; must be explicitly\nselected)
conname	name	 	Constraint name (not necessarily unique!)
connamespace	oid	pg_namespace.oid	The OID of the namespace that contains this constraint
contype	char	 	c = check constraint, f = foreign key constraint, p = primary key constraint, u = unique constraint, t =\nconstraint trigger, x = exclusion constraint
condeferrable	bool	 	Is the constraint deferrable?
condeferred	bool	 	Is the constraint deferred by default?
convalidated	bool	 	Has the constraint been validated? Currently, can only be false\nfor foreign keys and CHECK constraints
conrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table this constraint is on; 0 if not a table\nconstraint
contypid	oid	pg_type.oid	The domain this constraint is on; 0 if not a domain\nconstraint
conindid	oid	pg_class.oid	The index supporting this constraint, if it's a unique, primary\nkey, foreign key, or exclusion constraint; else 0
confrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	If a foreign key, the referenced table; else 0
confupdtype	char	 	Foreign key update action code: a = no\naction, r = restrict, c = cascade, n = set null, d = set default
confdeltype	char	 	Foreign key deletion action code: a =\nno action, r = restrict, c = cascade, n = set null, d = set default
confmatchtype	char	 	Foreign key match type: f = full,\np = partial, s = simple
conislocal	bool	 	This constraint is defined locally for the relation. Note that\na constraint can be locally defined and inherited simultaneously.
coninhcount	int4	 	The number of direct inheritance ancestors this constraint has.\nA constraint with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.
connoinherit	bool	 	This constraint is defined locally for the relation. It is a\nnon-inheritable constraint.
conkey	int2[]	pg_attribute.attnum	If a table constraint (including foreign keys, but not\nconstraint triggers), list of the constrained columns
confkey	int2[]	pg_attribute.attnum	If a foreign key, list of the referenced columns
conpfeqop	oid[]	pg_operator.oid	If a foreign key, list of the equality operators for PK = FK\ncomparisons
conppeqop	oid[]	pg_operator.oid	If a foreign key, list of the equality operators for PK = PK\ncomparisons
conffeqop	oid[]	pg_operator.oid	If a foreign key, list of the equality operators for FK = FK\ncomparisons
conexclop	oid[]	pg_operator.oid	If an exclusion constraint, list of the per-column exclusion\noperators
conbin	pg_node_tree	 	If a check constraint, an internal representation of the\nexpression
consrc	text	 	If a check constraint, a human-readable representation of the\nexpression
