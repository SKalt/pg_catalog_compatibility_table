Name	Type	References	Description
attrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table this column belongs to
attname	name	 	The column name
atttypid	oid	pg_type.oid	The data type of this column
attstattarget	int4	 	attstattarget controls the level\nof detail of statistics accumulated for this column by ANALYZE. A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A negative value says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is data type-dependent. For scalar data types, attstattarget is both the target number of "most common values" to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create.
attlen	int2	 	A copy of pg_type.typlen of this\ncolumn's type
attnum	int2	 	The number of the column. Ordinary columns are numbered from 1\nup. System columns, such as oid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers.
attndims	int4	 	Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise\n0. (Presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means "it's an array".)
attcacheoff	int4	 	Always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a row descriptor in\nmemory this might be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the row
atttypmod	int4	 	atttypmod records type-specific\ndata supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a varchar column). It is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. The value will generally be -1 for types that do not need atttypmod.
attbyval	bool	 	A copy of pg_type.typbyval of this\ncolumn's type
attstorage	char	 	Normally a copy of pg_type.typstorage\nof this column's type. For TOAST-able data types, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy.
attalign	char	 	A copy of pg_type.typalign of this\ncolumn's type
attnotnull	bool	 	This represents a not-null constraint. It is possible to change\nthis column to enable or disable the constraint.
atthasdef	bool	 	This column has a default value, in which case there will be a\ncorresponding entry in the pg_attrdef catalog that actually defines the value.
attisdropped	bool	 	This column has been dropped and is no longer valid. A dropped\ncolumn is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL.
attislocal	bool	 	This column is defined locally in the relation. Note that a\ncolumn can be locally defined and inherited simultaneously.
attinhcount	int4	 	The number of direct ancestors this column has. A column with a\nnonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.
attcollation	oid	pg_collation.oid	The defined collation of the column, or zero if the column is\nnot of a collatable data type.
attacl	aclitem[]	 	Column-level access privileges, if any have been granted\nspecifically on this column
attoptions	text[]	 	Attribute-level options, as "keyword=value" strings
attfdwoptions	text[]	 	Attribute-level foreign data wrapper options, as "keyword=value" strings
