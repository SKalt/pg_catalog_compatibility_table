oid	oid	 	Row identifier (hidden attribute; must be explicitly selected)
tgrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table this trigger is on
tgname	name	 	Trigger name (must be unique among triggers of same table)
tgfoid	oid	pg_proc.oid	The function to be called
tgtype	int2	 	Bit mask identifying trigger firing conditions

tgisinternal	bool	 	True if trigger is internally generated (usually, to enforce the constraint identified by tgconstraint)
tgconstrrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table referenced by a referential integrity constraint
tgconstrindid	oid	pg_class.oid	The index supporting a unique, primary key, or referential integrity constraint
tgconstraint	oid	pg_constraint.oid	The pg_constraint entry associated with the trigger, if any
tgdeferrable	bool	 	True if constraint trigger is deferrable
tginitdeferred	bool	 	True if constraint trigger is initially deferred
tgnargs	int2	 	Number of argument strings passed to trigger function
tgattr	int2vector	pg_attribute.attnum	Column numbers, if trigger is column-specific; otherwise an empty array
tgargs	bytea	 	Argument strings to pass to trigger, each NULL-terminated
tgqual	pg_node_tree	 	Expression tree (in nodeToString() representation) for the trigger's WHEN condition, or null if none
