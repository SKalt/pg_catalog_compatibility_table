Index	Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
0	attrelid	oid		pg_class.oid	"the table this column belongs to"
1	attname	name			"the column name"
2	atttypid	oid		pg_type.oid	"the data type of this column"
3	attstattarget	int4			"attstattarget controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by analyze. a zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. a negative value says to use the system default statistics target. the exact meaning of positive values is data type-dependent. for scalar data types, attstattarget is both the target number of ""most common values"" to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create"
4	attlen	int2			"a copy of pg_type.typlen of this column's type"
5	attnum	int2			"the number of the column. ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. system columns, such as oid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers"
6	attndims	int4			"number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise 0. (presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means ""it's an array"")"
7	attcacheoff	int4			"always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a row descriptor in memory this may be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the row"
8	atttypmod	int4			"atttypmod records type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a varchar column). it is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. the value will generally be -1 for types that do not need atttypmod"
9	attbyval	bool			"a copy of pg_type.typbyval of this column's type"
10	attstorage	char			"normally a copy of pg_type.typstorage of this column's type. for toast-able data types, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy"
11	attalign	char			"a copy of pg_type.typalign of this column's type"
12	attnotnull	bool			"this represents a not-null constraint. it is possible to change this column to enable or disable the constraint"
13	atthasdef	bool			"this column has a default value, in which case there will be a corresponding entry in the pg_attrdef catalog that actually defines the value"
14	attisdropped	bool			"this column has been dropped and is no longer valid. a dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via sql"
15	attislocal	bool			"this column is defined locally in the relation. note that a column may be locally defined and inherited simultaneously"
16	attinhcount	int4			"the number of direct ancestors this column has. a column with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed"
