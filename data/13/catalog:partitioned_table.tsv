Name	Type	References	Description
partrelid	oid	pg_partitioned_table.[object Object]	The OID of the pg_class entry for this partitioned table
partstrat	char		Partitioning strategy; h = hash partitioned table, l = list partitioned table, r = range partitioned table
partnatts	int2		The number of columns in partition key
partdefid	oid	pg_partitioned_table.[object Object]	The OID of the pg_class entry for the default partition of this partitioned table, or zero if this partitioned table does not have a default partition.
partattrs	int2vector	pg_partitioned_table.[object Object]	This is an array of partnatts values that indicate which table columns are part of the partition key. For example, a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns make up the partition key. A zero in this array indicates that the corresponding partition key column is an expression, rather than a simple column reference.
partclass	oidvector	pg_partitioned_table.[object Object]	For each column in the partition key, this contains the OID of the operator class to use. See pg_opclass for details.
partcollation	oidvector	pg_partitioned_table.[object Object]	For each column in the partition key, this contains the OID of the collation to use for partitioning, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type.
partexprs	pg_node_tree		Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for partition key columns that are not simple column references. This is a list with one element for each zero entry in partattrs. Null if all partition key columns are simple references.
