castsource	oid	pg_type.oid	OID of the source data type
casttarget	oid	pg_type.oid	OID of the target data type
castfunc	oid	pg_proc.oid	The OID of the function to use to perform this cast. Zero is stored if the cast method doesn't require a function.
castcontext	char	 	Indicates what contexts the cast can be invoked in. e means only as an explicit cast (using CAST or :: syntax). a means implicitly in assignment to a target column, as well as explicitly. i means implicitly in expressions, as well as the other cases.
