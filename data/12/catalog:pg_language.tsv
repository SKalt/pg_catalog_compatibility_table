lanispl	bool	 	This is false for internal languages (such as SQL) and true for user-defined languages. Currently, pg_dump still uses this to determine which languages need to be dumped, but this might be replaced by a different mechanism in the future.
lanpltrusted	bool	 	True if this is a trusted language, which means that it is believed not to grant access to anything outside the normal SQL execution environment. Only superusers can create functions in untrusted languages.

laninline	oid	pg_proc.oid	"This references a function that is responsible for executing ""inline"" anonymous code blocks (DO blocks). Zero if inline blocks are not supported."
lanvalidator	oid	pg_proc.oid	This references a language validator function that is responsible for checking the syntax and validity of new functions when they are created. Zero if no validator is provided.
lanacl	aclitem[]	 	Access privileges; see Section 5.7 for details
