Name	Type	References	Description
attrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table this column belongs to
attname	name	 	The column name
atttypid	oid	pg_type.oid	The data type of this column
attstattarget	int4	 	"attstattarget controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by ANALYZE. A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A negative value says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is data type-dependent. For scalar data types, attstattarget is both the target number of ""most common values"" to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create."
attlen	int2	 	A copy of pg_type.typlen of this column's type
attnum	int2	 	The number of the column. Ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. System columns, such as ctid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers.
attndims	int4	 	"Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise 0. (Presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means ""it's an array"".)"
attcacheoff	int4	 	Always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a row descriptor in memory this might be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the row
atttypmod	int4	 	atttypmod records type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a varchar column). It is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. The value will generally be -1 for types that do not need atttypmod.
attbyval	bool	 	A copy of pg_type.typbyval of this column's type
attstorage	char	 	Normally a copy of pg_type.typstorage of this column's type. For TOAST-able data types, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy.
attalign	char	 	A copy of pg_type.typalign of this column's type
attnotnull	bool	 	This represents a not-null constraint.
atthasdef	bool	 	This column has a default expression or generation expression, in which case there will be a corresponding entry in the pg_attrdef catalog that actually defines the expression. (Check attgenerated to determine whether this is a default or a generation expression.)
atthasmissing	bool	 	This column has a value which is used where the column is entirely missing from the row, as happens when a column is added with a non-volatile DEFAULT value after the row is created. The actual value used is stored in the attmissingval column.
attidentity	char	 	If a zero byte (''), then not an identity column. Otherwise, a = generated always, d = generated by default.
attgenerated	char	 	If a zero byte (''), then not a generated column. Otherwise, s = stored. (Other values might be added in the future.)
attisdropped	bool	 	This column has been dropped and is no longer valid. A dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL.
attislocal	bool	 	This column is defined locally in the relation. Note that a column can be locally defined and inherited simultaneously.
attinhcount	int4	 	The number of direct ancestors this column has. A column with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.
attcollation	oid	pg_collation.oid	The defined collation of the column, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type.
attacl	aclitem[]	 	Column-level access privileges, if any have been granted specifically on this column
attoptions	text[]	 	"Attribute-level options, as ""keyword=value"" strings"
attfdwoptions	text[]	 	"Attribute-level foreign data wrapper options, as ""keyword=value"" strings"
attmissingval	anyarray	 	This column has a one element array containing the value used when the column is entirely missing from the row, as happens when the column is added with a non-volatile DEFAULT value after the row is created. The value is only used when atthasmissing is true. If there is no value the column is null.
