schemaname	name		"name of schema containing table"
tablename	name		"name of table"
statistics_schemaname	name		"name of schema containing extended statistics object"
statistics_name	name		"name of extended statistics object"
statistics_owner	name		"owner of the extended statistics object"
attnames	name[]		"names of the columns included in the extended statistics object"
exprs	text[]		"expressions included in the extended statistics object"
kinds	char[]		"types of extended statistics object enabled for this record"
inherited	bool		"if true, the stats include values from child tables, not just the values in the specified relation"
n_distinct	pg_ndistinct		"n-distinct counts for combinations of column values. if greater than zero, the estimated number of distinct values in the combination. if less than zero, the negative of the number of distinct values divided by the number of rows. (the negated form is used when analyze believes that the number of distinct values is likely to increase as the table grows; the positive form is used when the column seems to have a fixed number of possible values.) for example, -1 indicates a unique combination of columns in which the number of distinct combinations is the same as the number of rows."
dependencies	pg_dependencies		"functional dependency statistics"
most_common_vals	text[]		"a list of the most common combinations of values in the columns. (null if no combinations seem to be more common than any others.)"
most_common_val_nulls	bool[]		"a list of null flags for the most common combinations of values. (null when most_common_vals is.)"
most_common_freqs	float8[]		"a list of the frequencies of the most common combinations, i.e., number of occurrences of each divided by total number of rows. (null when most_common_vals is.)"
most_common_base_freqs	float8[]		"a list of the base frequencies of the most common combinations, i.e., product of per-value frequencies. (null when most_common_vals is.)"
