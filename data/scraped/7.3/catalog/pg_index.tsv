indexrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for this index"
indrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for the table this index is for"
indproc	regproc	pg_proc.oid	"the function's oid if this is a functional index, else zero"
indkey	int2vector	pg_attribute.attnum	"this is a vector (array) of up to index_max_keys values that indicate which table columns this index pertains to. for example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third column make up the index key. for a functional index, these columns are the inputs to the function, and the function's return value is the index key."
indclass	oidvector	pg_opclass.oid	"for each column in the index key this contains a reference to the ""operator class"" to use. see pg_opclass for details."
indisclustered	bool		"if true, the table was last clustered on this index."
indisunique	bool		"if true, this is a unique index."
indisprimary	bool		"if true, this index represents the primary key of the table. (indisunique should always be true when this is true.)"
indreference	oid		unused
indpred	text		"expression tree (in the form of a nodetostring representation) for partial index predicate. empty string if not a partial index."
