Name	Type	References	Description
indexrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for this index"
indrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for the table this index is for"
indnatts	int2		"the number of columns in the index (duplicates pg_class.relnatts)"
indisunique	bool		"if true, this is a unique index"
indisprimary	bool		"if true, this index represents the primary key of the table (indisunique should always be true when this is true)"
indisexclusion	bool		"if true, this index supports an exclusion constraint"
indimmediate	bool		"if true, the uniqueness check is enforced immediately on insertion (irrelevant if indisunique is not true)"
indisclustered	bool		"if true, the table was last clustered on this index"
indisvalid	bool		"if true, the index is currently valid for queries. false means the index is possibly incomplete: it must still be modified by insert/update operations, but it cannot safely be used for queries. if it is unique, the uniqueness property is not true either."
indcheckxmin	bool		"if true, queries must not use the index until the xmin of this pg_index row is below their transactionxmin event horizon, because the table may contain broken hot chains with incompatible rows that they can see"
indisready	bool		"if true, the index is currently ready for inserts. false means the index must be ignored by insert/update operations."
indkey	int2vector	pg_attribute.attnum	"this is an array of indnatts values that indicate which table columns this index indexes. for example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns make up the index key. a zero in this array indicates that the corresponding index attribute is an expression over the table columns, rather than a simple column reference."
indcollation	oidvector	pg_collation.oid	"for each column in the index key, this contains the oid of the collation to use for the index."
indclass	oidvector	pg_opclass.oid	"for each column in the index key, this contains the oid of the operator class to use. see pg_opclass for details."
indoption	int2vector		"this is an array of indnatts values that store per-column flag bits. the meaning of the bits is defined by the index's access method."
indexprs	pg_node_tree		"expression trees (in nodetostring() representation) for index attributes that are not simple column references. this is a list with one element for each zero entry in indkey. null if all index attributes are simple references."
indpred	pg_node_tree		"expression tree (in nodetostring() representation) for partial index predicate. null if not a partial index."
