Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
relacl	aclitem[]			"access privileges; see the descriptions of grant and revoke for details."
relam	oid		pg_am.oid	"if this is an index, the access method used (b-tree, hash, etc.)"
relchecks	int2			"number of check constraints on the table; see pg_constraint catalog"
relfilenode	oid			"name of the on-disk file of this relation; 0 if none"
relfkeys	int2			"unused (not the number of foreign keys on the table)"
relhasindex	bool			"true if this is a table and it has (or recently had) any indexes. this is set by create index, but not cleared immediately by drop index. vacuum clears relhasindex if it finds the table has no indexes."
relhasoids	bool			"true if we generate an oid for each row of the relation."
relhaspkey	bool			"true if the table has (or once had) a primary key."
relhasrules	bool			"table has rules; see pg_rewrite catalog"
relhassubclass	bool			"at least one table inherits from this one"
relisshared	bool			"true if this table is shared across all databases in the cluster. only certain system catalogs (such as pg_database) are shared."
relkind	char			"r = ordinary table, i = index, s = sequence, v = view, c = composite type, s = special, t = toast table"
relname	name			"name of the table, index, view, etc."
relnamespace	oid		pg_namespace.oid	"the oid of the namespace that contains this relation"

relrefs	int2			unused
reltoastidxid	oid		pg_class.oid	"for a toast table, the oid of its index. 0 if not a toast table."
reltoastrelid	oid		pg_class.oid	"oid of the toast table associated with this table, 0 if none. the toast table stores large attributes ""out of line"" in a secondary table."
reltriggers	int2			"number of triggers on the table; see pg_trigger catalog"
reltuples	float4			"number of rows in the table. this is only an estimate used by the planner. it is updated by vacuum, analyze, and create index."
reltype	oid		pg_type.oid	"the oid of the data type that corresponds to this table, if any (zero for indexes, which have no pg_type entry)"
