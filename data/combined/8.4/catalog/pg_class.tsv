Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
relacl	aclitem[]			"access privileges; see grant and revoke for details"
relam	oid		pg_am.oid	"if this is an index, the access method used (b-tree, hash, etc.)"
relchecks	int2			"number of check constraints on the table; see pg_constraint catalog"
relfilenode	oid			"name of the on-disk file of this relation; 0 if none"
relfrozenxid	xid			"all transaction ids before this one have been replaced with a permanent (""frozen"") transaction id in this table. this is used to track whether the table needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent transaction id wraparound or to allow pg_clog to be shrunk. zero (invalidtransactionid) if the relation is not a table"
relhasindex	bool			"true if this is a table and it has (or recently had) any indexes. this is set by create index, but not cleared immediately by drop index. vacuum clears relhasindex if it finds the table has no indexes"
relhasoids	bool			"true if we generate an oid for each row of the relation"
relhaspkey	bool			"true if the table has (or once had) a primary key"
relhasrules	bool			"true if table has (or once had) rules; see pg_rewrite catalog"
relhassubclass	bool			"true if table has (or once had) any inheritance children"
relhastriggers	bool			"true if table has (or once had) triggers; see pg_trigger catalog"
relisshared	bool			"true if this table is shared across all databases in the cluster. only certain system catalogs (such as pg_database) are shared"
relistemp	bool			"true if this table is a temporary relation. if so, only the creating session can safely access its contents"
relkind	char			"r = ordinary table, i = index, s = sequence, v = view, c = composite type, t = toast table"
relname	name			"name of the table, index, view, etc."
relnamespace	oid		pg_namespace.oid	"the oid of the namespace that contains this relation"
relnatts	int2			"number of user columns in the relation (system columns not counted). there must be this many corresponding entries in pg_attribute. see also pg_attribute.attnum"
reloptions	text[]			"access-method-specific options, as ""keyword=value"" strings"
relowner	oid		pg_authid.oid	"owner of the relation"
relpages	int4			"size of the on-disk representation of this table in pages (of size blcksz). this is only an estimate used by the planner. it is updated by vacuum, analyze, and a few ddl commands such as create index"
reltablespace	oid		pg_tablespace.oid	"the tablespace in which this relation is stored. if zero, the database's default tablespace is implied. (not meaningful if the relation has no on-disk file.)"
reltoastidxid	oid		pg_class.oid	"for a toast table, the oid of its index. 0 if not a toast table"
reltoastrelid	oid		pg_class.oid	"oid of the toast table associated with this table, 0 if none. the toast table stores large attributes ""out of line"" in a secondary table"
reltuples	float4			"number of rows in the table. this is only an estimate used by the planner. it is updated by vacuum, analyze, and a few ddl commands such as create index"
reltype	oid		pg_type.oid	"the oid of the data type that corresponds to this table's row type, if any (zero for indexes, which have no pg_type entry)"
