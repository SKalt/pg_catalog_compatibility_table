castfunc	oid	false	pg_proc.oid	"the oid of the function to use to perform this cast. zero is stored if the cast method doesn't require a function."
castcontext	char	false		"indicates what contexts the cast can be invoked in. e means only as an explicit cast (using cast or :: syntax). a means implicitly in assignment to a target column, as well as explicitly. i means implicitly in expressions, as well as the other cases."
