Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
proacl	aclitem[]			"access privileges; see grant and revoke for details"
proallargtypes	oid[]		pg_type.oid	"an array with the data types of the function arguments. this includes all arguments (including out and inout arguments); however, if all the arguments are in arguments, this field will be null. note that subscripting is 1-based, whereas for historical reasons proargtypes is subscripted from 0"
proargmodes	char[]			"an array with the modes of the function arguments, encoded as i for in arguments, o for out arguments, b for inout arguments. if all the arguments are in arguments, this field will be null. note that subscripts correspond to positions of proallargtypes not proargtypes"
proargnames	text[]			"an array with the names of the function arguments. arguments without a name are set to empty strings in the array. if none of the arguments have a name, this field will be null. note that subscripts correspond to positions of proallargtypes not proargtypes"
proargtypes	oidvector		pg_type.oid	"an array with the data types of the function arguments. this includes only input arguments (including inout arguments), and thus represents the call signature of the function"
probin	bytea			"additional information about how to invoke the function. again, the interpretation is language-specific"
proconfig	text[]			"function's local settings for run-time configuration variables"
procost	float4			"estimated execution cost (in units of cpu_operator_cost); if proretset, this is cost per row returned"
proisagg	bool			"function is an aggregate function"
proisstrict	bool			"function returns null if any call argument is null. in that case the function won't actually be called at all. functions that are not ""strict"" must be prepared to handle null inputs"
prolang	oid		pg_language.oid	"implementation language or call interface of this function"
proname	name			"name of the function"
pronamespace	oid		pg_namespace.oid	"the oid of the namespace that contains this function"
pronargs	int2			"number of arguments"
proowner	oid		pg_authid.oid	"owner of the function"
proretset	bool			"function returns a set (i.e., multiple values of the specified data type)"
prorettype	oid		pg_type.oid	"data type of the return value"
prorows	float4			"estimated number of result rows (zero if not proretset)"
prosecdef	bool			"function is a security definer (i.e., a ""setuid"" function)"
prosrc	text			"this tells the function handler how to invoke the function. it might be the actual source code of the function for interpreted languages, a link symbol, a file name, or just about anything else, depending on the implementation language/call convention"
provolatile	char			"provolatile tells whether the function's result depends only on its input arguments, or is affected by outside factors. it is i for ""immutable"" functions, which always deliver the same result for the same inputs. it is s for ""stable"" functions, whose results (for fixed inputs) do not change within a scan. it is v for ""volatile"" functions, whose results might change at any time. (use v also for functions with side-effects, so that calls to them cannot get optimized away.)"
