kinds	text[]	true		"types of extended statistics enabled for this record"
n_distinct	pg_ndistinct	true		"n-distinct counts for combinations of column values. if greater than zero, the estimated number of distinct values in the combination. if less than zero, the negative of the number of distinct values divided by the number of rows. (the negated form is used when analyze believes that the number of distinct values is likely to increase as the table grows; the positive form is used when the column seems to have a fixed number of possible values.) for example, -1 indicates a unique combination of columns in which the number of distinct combinations is the same as the number of rows."
dependencies	pg_dependencies	true		"functional dependency statistics"
most_common_vals	anyarray	true		"a list of the most common combinations of values in the columns. (null if no combinations seem to be more common than any others.)"
most_common_val_nulls	anyarray	true		"a list of null flags for the most common combinations of values. (null when most_common_vals is.)"
most_common_freqs	float4[]	true		"a list of the frequencies of the most common combinations, i.e., number of occurrences of each divided by total number of rows. (null when most_common_vals is.)"
most_common_base_freqs	float4[]	true		"a list of the base frequencies of the most common combinations, i.e., product of per-value frequencies. (null when most_common_vals is.)"
