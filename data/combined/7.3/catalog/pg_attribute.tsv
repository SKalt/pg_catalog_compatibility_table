Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
attalign	char			"a copy of pg_type.typalign of this column's type"
attbyval	bool			"a copy of pg_type.typbyval of this column's type"
attcacheoff	int4			"always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a tuple descriptor in memory this may be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the tuple."
atthasdef	bool			"this column has a default value, in which case there will be a corresponding entry in the pg_attrdef catalog that actually defines the value."
attinhcount	int4			"the number of direct ancestors this column has. a column with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed."
attisdropped	bool			"this column has been dropped and is no longer valid. a dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via sql."
attislocal	bool			"this column is defined locally in the relation. note that a column may be locally defined and inherited simultaneously."
attisset	bool			"if true, this attribute is a set. in that case, what is really stored in the attribute is the oid of a tuple in the pg_proc catalog. the pg_proc tuple contains the query string that defines this set - i.e., the query to run to get the set. so the atttypid (see above) refers to the type returned by this query, but the actual length of this attribute is the length (size) of an oid. --- at least this is the theory. all this is probably quite broken these days."
attlen	int2			"this is a copy of pg_type.typlen of this column's type."
attname	name			"column name"
attndims	int4			"number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise 0. (presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means ""it's an array"".)"
attnotnull	bool			"this represents a not null constraint. it is possible to change this field to enable or disable the constraint."
attnum	int2			"the number of the column. ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. system columns, such as oid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers."
attrelid	oid		pg_class.oid	"the table this column belongs to"
attstattarget	int4			"attstattarget controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by analyze. a zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. a negative value says to use the system default statistics target. the exact meaning of positive values is datatype-dependent. for scalar datatypes, attstattarget is both the target number of ""most common values"" to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create."
attstorage	char			"normally a copy of pg_type.typstorage of this column's type. for toastable datatypes, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy."
atttypid	oid		pg_type.oid	"the data type of this column"
atttypmod	int4			"atttypmod records type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a varchar column). it is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. the value will generally be -1 for types that do not need typmod."
