Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
indclass	oidvector		pg_opclass.oid	"for each column in the index key this contains the oid of the operator class to use. see pg_opclass for details"
indexprs	text			"expression trees (in nodetostring() representation) for index attributes that are not simple column references. this is a list with one element for each zero entry in indkey. null if all index attributes are simple references"
indexrelid	oid		pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for this index"
indisclustered	bool			"if true, the table was last clustered on this index"
indisprimary	bool			"if true, this index represents the primary key of the table. (indisunique should always be true when this is true.)"
indisunique	bool			"if true, this is a unique index"
indisvalid	bool			"if true, the index is currently valid for queries. false means the index is possibly incomplete: it must still be modified by insert/update operations, but it cannot safely be used for queries. if it is unique, the uniqueness property is not true either"
indkey	int2vector		pg_attribute.attnum	"this is an array of indnatts values that indicate which table columns this index indexes. for example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns make up the index key. a zero in this array indicates that the corresponding index attribute is an expression over the table columns, rather than a simple column reference."
indnatts	int2			"the number of columns in the index (duplicates pg_class.relnatts)"
indpred	text			"expression tree (in nodetostring() representation) for partial index predicate. null if not a partial index"
indrelid	oid		pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for the table this index is for"
