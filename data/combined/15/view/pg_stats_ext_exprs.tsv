schemaname	name	true		"name of schema containing tabl"
tablename	name	true		"name of table the statistics object is defined o"
statistics_schemaname	name	true		"name of schema containing extended statistics objec"
statistics_name	name	true		"name of extended statistics objec"
statistics_owner	name	true		"owner of the extended statistics objec"
expr	text	true		"expression included in the extended statistics objec"
inherited	bool	true		"if true, the stats include values from child tables, not just the values in the specified relatio"
null_frac	float4	true		"fraction of expression entries that are nul"
avg_width	int4	true		"average width in bytes of expression's entrie"
n_distinct	float4	true		"if greater than zero, the estimated number of distinct values in the expression. if less than zero, the negative of the number of distinct values divided by the number of rows. (the negated form is used when analyze believes that the number of distinct values is likely to increase as the table grows; the positive form is used when the expression seems to have a fixed number of possible values.) for example, -1 indicates a unique expression in which the number of distinct values is the same as the number of rows"
most_common_vals	anyarray	true		"a list of the most common values in the expression. (null if no values seem to be more common than any others."
most_common_freqs	float4[]	true		"a list of the frequencies of the most common values, i.e., number of occurrences of each divided by total number of rows. (null when most_common_vals is."
histogram_bounds	anyarray	true		"a list of values that divide the expression's values into groups of approximately equal population. the values in most_common_vals, if present, are omitted from this histogram calculation. (this expression is null if the expression data type does not have a < operator or if the most_common_vals list accounts for the entire population."
correlation	float4	true		"statistical correlation between physical row ordering and logical ordering of the expression values. this ranges from -1 to +1. when the value is near -1 or +1, an index scan on the expression will be estimated to be cheaper than when it is near zero, due to reduction of random access to the disk. (this expression is null if the expression's data type does not have a < operator."
most_common_elems	anyarray	true		"a list of non-null element values most often appearing within values of the expression. (null for scalar types."
most_common_elem_freqs	float4[]	true		"a list of the frequencies of the most common element values, i.e., the fraction of rows containing at least one instance of the given value. two or three additional values follow the per-element frequencies; these are the minimum and maximum of the preceding per-element frequencies, and optionally the frequency of null elements. (null when most_common_elems is."
elem_count_histogram	float4[]	true		"a histogram of the counts of distinct non-null element values within the values of the expression, followed by the average number of distinct non-null elements. (null for scalar types."
