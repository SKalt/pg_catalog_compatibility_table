0	schemaname	NAME			"name of schema containing table"
1	tablename	NAME			"name of table"
2	attname	NAME			"name of column described by this row"
3	inherited	BOOL			"if true, this row includes values from child tables, not just the values in the specified table"
4	null_frac	FLOAT4			"fraction of column entries that are null"
5	avg_width	INT4			"average width in bytes of column's entries"
6	n_distinct	FLOAT4			"if greater than zero, the estimated number of distinct values in the column. if less than zero, the negative of the number of distinct values divided by the number of rows. (the negated form is used when analyze believes that the number of distinct values is likely to increase as the table grows; the positive form is used when the column seems to have a fixed number of possible values.) for example, -1 indicates a unique column in which the number of distinct values is the same as the number of rows."
7	most_common_vals	ANYARRAY			"a list of the most common values in the column. (null if no values seem to be more common than any others.)"
8	most_common_freqs	FLOAT4[]			"a list of the frequencies of the most common values, i.e., number of occurrences of each divided by total number of rows. (null when most_common_vals is.)"
9	histogram_bounds	ANYARRAY			"a list of values that divide the column's values into groups of approximately equal population. the values in most_common_vals, if present, are omitted from this histogram calculation. (this column is null if the column data type does not have a < operator or if the most_common_vals list accounts for the entire population.)"
10	correlation	FLOAT4			"statistical correlation between physical row ordering and logical ordering of the column values. this ranges from -1 to +1. when the value is near -1 or +1, an index scan on the column will be estimated to be cheaper than when it is near zero, due to reduction of random access to the disk. (this column is null if the column data type does not have a < operator.)"
11	most_common_elems	ANYARRAY			"a list of non-null element values most often appearing within values of the column. (null for scalar types.)"
12	most_common_elem_freqs	FLOAT4[]			"a list of the frequencies of the most common element values, i.e., the fraction of rows containing at least one instance of the given value. two or three additional values follow the per-element frequencies; these are the minimum and maximum of the preceding per-element frequencies, and optionally the frequency of null elements. (null when most_common_elems is.)"
13	elem_count_histogram	FLOAT4[]			"a histogram of the counts of distinct non-null element values within the values of the column, followed by the average number of distinct non-null elements. (null for scalar types.)"
