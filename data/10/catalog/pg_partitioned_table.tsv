Index	Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
0	partrelid	OID		pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for this partitioned table"
1	partstrat	CHAR			"partitioning strategy; l = list partitioned table, r = range partitioned table"
2	partnatts	INT2			"the number of columns in partition key"
3	partattrs	INT2VECTOR		pg_attribute.attnum	"this is an array of partnatts values that indicate which table columns are part of the partition key. for example, a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns make up the partition key. a zero in this array indicates that the corresponding partition key column is an expression, rather than a simple column reference."
4	partclass	OIDVECTOR		pg_opclass.oid	"for each column in the partition key, this contains the oid of the operator class to use. see pg_opclass for details."
5	partcollation	OIDVECTOR		pg_opclass.oid	"for each column in the partition key, this contains the oid of the collation to use for partitioning, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type."
6	partexprs	PG_NODE_TREE			"expression trees (in nodetostring() representation) for partition key columns that are not simple column references. this is a list with one element for each zero entry in partattrs. null if all partition key columns are simple references."
