Index	Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
1	proname	name			"name of the function"
2	pronamespace	oid		pg_namespace.oid	"the oid of the namespace that contains this function"
3	proowner	oid		pg_authid.oid	"owner of the function"
4	prolang	oid		pg_language.oid	"implementation language or call interface of this function"
5	procost	float4			"estimated execution cost (in units of cpu_operator_cost); if proretset, this is cost per row returned"
6	prorows	float4			"estimated number of result rows (zero if not proretset)"
7	provariadic	oid		pg_type.oid	"data type of the variadic array parameter's elements, or zero if the function does not have a variadic parameter"
8	proisagg	bool			"function is an aggregate function"
9	proiswindow	bool			"function is a window function"
10	prosecdef	bool			"function is a security definer (i.e., a ""setuid"" function)"
11	proisstrict	bool			"function returns null if any call argument is null. in that case the function won't actually be called at all. functions that are not ""strict"" must be prepared to handle null inputs."
12	proretset	bool			"function returns a set (i.e., multiple values of the specified data type)"
13	provolatile	char			"provolatile tells whether the function's result depends only on its input arguments, or is affected by outside factors. it is i for ""immutable"" functions, which always deliver the same result for the same inputs. it is s for ""stable"" functions, whose results (for fixed inputs) do not change within a scan. it is v for ""volatile"" functions, whose results might change at any time. (use v also for functions with side-effects, so that calls to them cannot get optimized away.)"
14	pronargs	int2			"number of input arguments"
15	pronargdefaults	int2			"number of arguments that have defaults"
16	prorettype	oid		pg_type.oid	"data type of the return value"
17	proargtypes	oidvector		pg_type.oid	"an array with the data types of the function arguments. this includes only input arguments (including inout and variadic arguments), and thus represents the call signature of the function."
18	proallargtypes	oid[]		pg_type.oid	"an array with the data types of the function arguments. this includes all arguments (including out and inout arguments); however, if all the arguments are in arguments, this field will be null. note that subscripting is 1-based, whereas for historical reasons proargtypes is subscripted from 0."
19	proargmodes	char[]			"an array with the modes of the function arguments, encoded as i for in arguments, o for out arguments, b for inout arguments, v for variadic arguments, t for table arguments. if all the arguments are in arguments, this field will be null. note that subscripts correspond to positions of proallargtypes not proargtypes."
20	proargnames	text[]			"an array with the names of the function arguments. arguments without a name are set to empty strings in the array. if none of the arguments have a name, this field will be null. note that subscripts correspond to positions of proallargtypes not proargtypes."
21	proargdefaults	pg_node_tree			"expression trees (in nodetostring() representation) for default values. this is a list with pronargdefaults elements, corresponding to the last n input arguments (i.e., the last n proargtypes positions). if none of the arguments have defaults, this field will be null."
22	prosrc	text			"this tells the function handler how to invoke the function. it might be the actual source code of the function for interpreted languages, a link symbol, a file name, or just about anything else, depending on the implementation language/call convention."
23	probin	text			"additional information about how to invoke the function. again, the interpretation is language-specific."
24	proconfig	text[]			"function's local settings for run-time configuration variables"
25	proacl	aclitem[]			"access privileges; see grant and revoke for details"
