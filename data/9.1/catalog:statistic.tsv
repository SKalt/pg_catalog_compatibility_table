Name	Type	References	Description
starelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table or index that the described column belongs to
staattnum	int2	pg_attribute.attnum	The number of the described column
stainherit	bool	 	If true, the stats include inheritance child columns, not just the values in the specified relation
stanullfrac	float4	 	The fraction of the column's entries that are null
stawidth	int4	 	The average stored width, in bytes, of nonnull entries
stadistinct	float4	 	The number of distinct nonnull data values in the column. A value greater than zero is the actual number of distinct values. A value less than zero is the negative of a multiplier for the number of rows in the table; for example, a column in which about 80% of the values are nonnull and each nonnull value appears about twice on average could be represented by stadistinct = -0.4. A zero value means the number of distinct values is unknown.
stakindN	int2	 	A code number indicating the kind of statistics stored in the Nth "slot" of the pg_statistic row.
staopN	oid	pg_operator.oid	An operator used to derive the statistics stored in the Nth "slot". For example, a histogram slot would show the < operator that defines the sort order of the data.
stanumbersN	float4[]	 	Numerical statistics of the appropriate kind for the Nth "slot", or null if the slot kind does not involve numerical values
stavaluesN	anyarray	 	Column data values of the appropriate kind for the Nth "slot", or null if the slot kind does not store any data values. Each array's element values are actually of the specific column's data type, so there is no way to define these columns' type more specifically than anyarray.
