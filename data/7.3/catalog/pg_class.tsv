Index	Name	Type	Nullable	References	Description
0	relname	NAME			"name of the table, index, view, etc."
1	relnamespace	OID		pg_namespace.oid	"the oid of the namespace that contains this relation"
2	reltype	OID		pg_type.oid	"the oid of the data type that corresponds to this table, if any (zero for indexes, which have no pg_type entry)"
3	relowner	INT4		pg_shadow.usesysid	"owner of the relation"
4	relam	OID		pg_am.oid	"if this is an index, the access method used (b-tree, hash, etc.)"
5	relfilenode	OID			"name of the on-disk file of this relation; 0 if none"
6	relpages	INT4			"size of the on-disk representation of this table in pages (size blcksz). this is only an estimate used by the planner. it is updated by vacuum, analyze, and create index."
7	reltuples	FLOAT4			"number of tuples in the table. this is only an estimate used by the planner. it is updated by vacuum, analyze, and create index."
8	reltoastrelid	OID		pg_class.oid	"oid of the toast table associated with this table, 0 if none. the toast table stores large attributes ""out of line"" in a secondary table."
9	reltoastidxid	OID		pg_class.oid	"for a toast table, the oid of its index. 0 if not a toast table."
10	relhasindex	BOOL			"true if this is a table and it has (or recently had) any indexes. this is set by create index, but not cleared immediately by drop index. vacuum clears relhasindex if it finds the table has no indexes."
11	relisshared	BOOL			"true if this table is shared across all databases in the cluster. only certain system catalogs (such as pg_database) are shared."
12	relkind	CHAR			"'r' = ordinary table, 'i' = index, 's' = sequence, 'v' = view, 'c' = composite type, 's' = special, 't' = toast table"
13	relnatts	INT2			"number of user columns in the relation (system columns not counted). there must be this many corresponding entries in pg_attribute. see also pg_attribute.attnum."
14	relchecks	INT2			"number of check constraints on the table; see pg_constraint catalog"
15	reltriggers	INT2			"number of triggers on the table; see pg_trigger catalog"
16	relukeys	INT2			"unused (not the number of unique keys)"
17	relfkeys	INT2			"unused (not the number of foreign keys on the table)"
18	relrefs	INT2			unused
19	relhasoids	BOOL			"true if we generate an oid for each row of the relation."
20	relhaspkey	BOOL			"true if the table has (or once had) a primary key."
21	relhasrules	BOOL			"table has rules; see pg_rewrite catalog"
22	relhassubclass	BOOL			"at least one table inherits from this one"
