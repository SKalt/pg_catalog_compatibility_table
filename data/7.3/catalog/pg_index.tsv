Index	Name	Type	References	Description
0	indexrelid	OID		pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for this index"
1	indrelid	OID		pg_class.oid	"the oid of the pg_class entry for the table this index is for"
2	indproc	REGPROC		pg_proc.oid	"the function's oid if this is a functional index, else zero"
3	indkey	INT2VECTOR		pg_attribute.attnum	"this is a vector (array) of up to index_max_keys values that indicate which table columns this index pertains to. for example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third column make up the index key. for a functional index, these columns are the inputs to the function, and the function's return value is the index key."
4	indclass	OIDVECTOR		pg_opclass.oid	"for each column in the index key this contains a reference to the ""operator class"" to use. see pg_opclass for details."
5	indisclustered	BOOL			"if true, the table was last clustered on this index."
6	indisunique	BOOL			"if true, this is a unique index."
7	indisprimary	BOOL			"if true, this index represents the primary key of the table. (indisunique should always be true when this is true.)"
8	indreference	OID			unused
9	indpred	TEXT			"expression tree (in the form of a nodetostring representation) for partial index predicate. empty string if not a partial index."
