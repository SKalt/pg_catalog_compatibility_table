Name	Type	References	Description
starelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table that the described column belongs to
staattnum	int2	pg_attribute.attnum	The number of the described column
stanullfrac	float4	 	The fraction of the column's entries that are NULL
stawidth	int4	 	The average stored width, in bytes, of non-NULL entries
stadistinct	float4	 	The number of distinct non-NULL data values in the column. A value greater than zero is the actual number of distinct values. A value less than zero is the negative of a fraction of the number of rows in the table (for example, a column in which values appear about twice on the average could be represented by stadistinct = -0.5). A zero value means the number of distinct values is unknown.
stakindN	int2	 	A code number indicating the kind of statistics stored in the Nth "slot" of the pg_statistic row.
staopN	oid	pg_operator.oid	An operator used to derive the statistics stored in the Nth "slot". For example, a histogram slot would show the < operator that defines the sort order of the data.
stanumbersN	float4[]	 	Numerical statistics of the appropriate kind for the Nth "slot", or NULL if the slot kind does not involve numerical values.
stavaluesN	text[]	 	Column data values of the appropriate kind for the Nth "slot", or NULL if the slot kind does not store any data values. For data-type independence, all column data values are converted to external textual form and stored as TEXT datums.
