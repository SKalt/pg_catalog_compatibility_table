Name	Type	References	Description
attrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table this column belongs to
attname	name	 	Column name
atttypid	oid	pg_type.oid	The data type of this column
attstattarget	int4	 	attstattarget controls\n the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by ANALYZE. A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A negative value says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is datatype-dependent. For scalar datatypes, attstattarget is both the target number of "most common values" to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create.
attlen	int2	 	This is a copy of pg_type.typlen of this column's type.
attnum	int2	 	The number of the column. Ordinary columns are\n numbered from 1 up. System columns, such as oid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers.
attndims	int4	 	Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type;\n otherwise 0. (Presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means "it's an array".)
attcacheoff	int4	 	Always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a tuple\n descriptor in memory this may be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the tuple.
atttypmod	int4	 	atttypmod records\n type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a varchar column). It is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. The value will generally be -1 for types that do not need typmod.
attbyval	bool	 	A copy of pg_type.typbyval of this column's type
attstorage	char	 	Normally a copy of pg_type.typstorage of this column's type. For\n TOASTable datatypes, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy.
attisset	bool	 	If true, this attribute is a set. In that case, what\n is really stored in the attribute is the OID of a tuple in the pg_proc catalog. The pg_proc tuple contains the query string that defines this set - i.e., the query to run to get the set. So the atttypid (see above) refers to the type returned by this query, but the actual length of this attribute is the length (size) of an oid. --- At least this is the theory. All this is probably quite broken these days.
attalign	char	 	A copy of pg_type.typalign of this column's type
attnotnull	bool	 	This represents a NOT NULL constraint. It is possible\n to change this field to enable or disable the constraint.
atthasdef	bool	 	This column has a default value, in which case there\n will be a corresponding entry in the pg_attrdef catalog that actually defines the value.
attisdropped	bool	 	This column has been dropped and is no longer valid.\n A dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL.
attislocal	bool	 	This column is defined locally in the relation. Note\n that a column may be locally defined and inherited simultaneously.
attinhcount	int4	 	The number of direct ancestors this column has. A\n column with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.
