Name	Type	References	Description
indexrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The OID of the pg_class entry for this index
indrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The OID of the pg_class entry for the table this index is for
indproc	regproc	pg_proc.oid	The function's OID if this is a functional index, else zero
indkey	int2vector	pg_attribute.attnum	This is a vector (array) of up to INDEX_MAX_KEYS values that indicate which table columns this index pertains to. For example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third column make up the index key. For a functional index, these columns are the inputs to the function, and the function's return value is the index key.
indclass	oidvector	pg_opclass.oid	"For each column in the index key this contains a reference to the ""operator class"" to use. See pg_opclass for details."
indisclustered	bool	 	If true, the table was last clustered on this index.
indisunique	bool	 	If true, this is a unique index.
indisprimary	bool	 	If true, this index represents the primary key of the table. (indisunique should always be true when this is true.)
indreference	oid	 	unused
indpred	text	 	Expression tree (in the form of a nodeToString representation) for partial index predicate. Empty string if not a partial index.
