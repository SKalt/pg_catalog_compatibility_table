Name	Type	References	Description
indexrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The OID of the pg_class entry for this index
indrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The OID of the pg_class entry for the table this index is for
indnatts	int2	 	The number of columns in the index (duplicates pg_class.relnatts)
indisunique	bool	 	If true, this is a unique index.
indisprimary	bool	 	If true, this index represents the primary key of the table. (indisunique should always be true when this is true.)
indisclustered	bool	 	If true, the table was last clustered on this index.
indkey	int2vector	pg_attribute.attnum	This is an array of indnatts values that indicate which table columns this index indexes. For example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns make up the index key. A zero in this array indicates that the corresponding index attribute is an expression over the table columns, rather than a simple column reference.
indclass	oidvector	pg_opclass.oid	For each column in the index key this contains the OID of the operator class to use. See pg_opclass for details.
indexprs	text	 	Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for index attributes that are not simple column references. This is a list with one element for each zero entry in indkey. Null if all index attributes are simple references.
indpred	text	 	Expression tree (in nodeToString() representation) for partial index predicate. Null if not a partial index.
