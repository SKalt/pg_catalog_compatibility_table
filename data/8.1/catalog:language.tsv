Name	Type	References	Description
lanname	name	 	Name of the language
lanispl	bool	 	This is false for internal languages (such as SQL) and true for user-defined languages. Currently, pg_dump still uses this to determine which languages need to be dumped, but this may be replaced by a different mechanism sometime.
lanpltrusted	bool	 	True if this is a trusted language, which means that it is believed not to grant access to anything outside the normal SQL execution environment. Only superusers may create functions in untrusted languages.
lanplcallfoid	oid	pg_proc.oid	For noninternal languages this references the language handler, which is a special function that is responsible for executing all functions that are written in the particular language.
lanvalidator	oid	pg_proc.oid	This references a language validator function that is responsible for checking the syntax and validity of new functions when they are created. Zero if no validator is provided.
lanacl	aclitem[]	 	Access privileges; see GRANT and REVOKE for details.
