Name	Type	References	Description
oid	oid		Row identifier
conname	name		Constraint name (not necessarily unique!)
connamespace	oid	pg_constraint.oid	The OID of the namespace that contains this constraint
contype	char		c = check constraint, f = foreign key constraint, p = primary key constraint, u = unique constraint, t = constraint trigger, x = exclusion constraint
condeferrable	bool		Is the constraint deferrable?
condeferred	bool		Is the constraint deferred by default?
convalidated	bool		Has the constraint been validated? Currently, can be false only for foreign keys and CHECK constraints
conrelid	oid	pg_constraint.oid	The table this constraint is on; zero if not a table constraint
contypid	oid	pg_constraint.oid	The domain this constraint is on; zero if not a domain constraint
conindid	oid	pg_constraint.oid	The index supporting this constraint, if it's a unique, primary key, foreign key, or exclusion constraint; else zero
conparentid	oid	pg_constraint.oid	The corresponding constraint of the parent partitioned table, if this is a constraint on a partition; else zero
confrelid	oid	pg_constraint.oid	If a foreign key, the referenced table; else zero
confupdtype	char		Foreign key update action code: a = no action, r = restrict, c = cascade, n = set null, d = set default
confdeltype	char		Foreign key deletion action code: a = no action, r = restrict, c = cascade, n = set null, d = set default
confmatchtype	char		Foreign key match type: f = full, p = partial, s = simple
conislocal	bool		This constraint is defined locally for the relation. Note that a constraint can be locally defined and inherited simultaneously.
coninhcount	int4		The number of direct inheritance ancestors this constraint has. A constraint with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.
connoinherit	bool		This constraint is defined locally for the relation. It is a non-inheritable constraint.
conkey	int2[]	pg_constraint.attnum	If a table constraint (including foreign keys, but not constraint triggers), list of the constrained columns
confkey	int2[]	pg_constraint.attnum	If a foreign key, list of the referenced columns
conpfeqop	oid[]	pg_constraint.oid	If a foreign key, list of the equality operators for PK = FK comparisons
conppeqop	oid[]	pg_constraint.oid	If a foreign key, list of the equality operators for PK = PK comparisons
conffeqop	oid[]	pg_constraint.oid	If a foreign key, list of the equality operators for FK = FK comparisons
conexclop	oid[]	pg_constraint.oid	If an exclusion constraint, list of the per-column exclusion operators
conbin	pg_node_tree		If a check constraint, an internal representation of the expression. (It's recommended to use pg_get_constraintdef() to extract the definition of a check constraint.)
