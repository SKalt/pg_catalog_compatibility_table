Name	Type	References	Description
name	text		The name of the shared memory allocation. NULL for unused memory and <anonymous> for anonymous allocations.
off	int8		The offset at which the allocation starts. NULL for anonymous allocations, since details related to them are not known.
size	int8		Size of the allocation
allocated_size	int8		Size of the allocation including padding. For anonymous allocations, no information about padding is available, so the size and allocated_size columns will always be equal. Padding is not meaningful for free memory, so the columns will be equal in that case also.
