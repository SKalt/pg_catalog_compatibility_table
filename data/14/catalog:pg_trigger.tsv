Name	Type	References	Description
oid	oid		Row identifier
tgrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table this trigger is on
tgparentid	oid	pg_trigger.oid	Parent trigger that this trigger is cloned from (this happens when partitions are created or attached to a partitioned table); zero if not a clone
tgname	name		Trigger name (must be unique among triggers of same table)
tgfoid	oid	pg_proc.oid	The function to be called
tgtype	int2		Bit mask identifying trigger firing conditions
tgenabled	char		"Controls in which session_replication_role modes the trigger fires. O = trigger fires in ""origin"" and ""local"" modes, D = trigger is disabled, R = trigger fires in ""replica"" mode, A = trigger fires always."
tgisinternal	bool		True if trigger is internally generated (usually, to enforce the constraint identified by tgconstraint)
tgconstrrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table referenced by a referential integrity constraint (zero if trigger is not for a referential integrity constraint)
tgconstrindid	oid	pg_class.oid	The index supporting a unique, primary key, referential integrity, or exclusion constraint (zero if trigger is not for one of these types of constraint)
tgconstraint	oid	pg_constraint.oid	The pg_constraint entry associated with the trigger (zero if trigger is not for a constraint)
tgdeferrable	bool		True if constraint trigger is deferrable
tginitdeferred	bool		True if constraint trigger is initially deferred
tgnargs	int2		Number of argument strings passed to trigger function
tgattr	int2vector	pg_attribute.attnum	Column numbers, if trigger is column-specific; otherwise an empty array
tgargs	bytea		Argument strings to pass to trigger, each NULL-terminated
tgqual	pg_node_tree		Expression tree (in nodeToString() representation) for the trigger's WHEN condition, or null if none
tgoldtable	name		REFERENCING clause name for OLD TABLE, or null if none
tgnewtable	name		REFERENCING clause name for NEW TABLE, or null if none
