2	relnamespace	oid	false		"the oid of the namespace that contains this relation"

8	reltablespace	oid	false		"the tablespace in which this relation is stored. if zero, the database's default tablespace is implied. (not meaningful if the relation has no on-disk file.)"
9	relpages	int4	false		"size of the on-disk representation of this table in pages (of size blcksz). this is only an estimate used by the planner. it is updated by vacuum, analyze, and a few ddl commands such as create index."

11	relallvisible	int4	false		"number of pages that are marked all-visible in the table's visibility map. this is only an estimate used by the planner. it is updated by vacuum, analyze, and a few ddl commands such as create index."
12	reltoastrelid	oid	false		"oid of the toast table associated with this table, 0 if none. the toast table stores large attributes ""out of line"" in a secondary table."
13	relhasindex	bool	false		"true if this is a table and it has (or recently had) any indexes"
14	relisshared	bool	false		"true if this table is shared across all databases in the cluster. only certain system catalogs (such as pg_database) are shared."

16	relkind	char	false		"r = ordinary table, i = index, s = sequence, v = view, m = materialized view, c = composite type, t = toast table, f = foreign table"
17	relnatts	int2	false		"number of user columns in the relation (system columns not counted). there must be this many corresponding entries in pg_attribute. see also pg_attribute.attnum."
18	relchecks	int2	false		"number of check constraints on the table; see pg_constraint catalog"
19	relhasoids	bool	false		"true if we generate an oid for each row of the relation"

27	relreplident	char	false		"columns used to form ""replica identity"" for rows: d = default (primary key, if any), n = nothing, f = all columns, i = index with indisreplident set (same as nothing if the index used has been dropped)"
28	relfrozenxid	xid	false		"all transaction ids before this one have been replaced with a permanent (""frozen"") transaction id in this table. this is used to track whether the table needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent transaction id wraparound or to allow pg_clog to be shrunk. zero (invalidtransactionid) if the relation is not a table."
29	relminmxid	xid	false		"all multixact ids before this one have been replaced by a transaction id in this table. this is used to track whether the table needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent multixact id wraparound or to allow pg_multixact to be shrunk. zero (invalidmultixactid) if the relation is not a table."
