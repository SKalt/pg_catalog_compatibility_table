Name	Type	References	Description
indexrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The OID of the pg_class\n entry for this index
indrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The OID of the pg_class\n entry for the table this index is for
indnatts	int2	 	The number of columns in the index (duplicates\n pg_class.relnatts)
indisunique	bool	 	If true, this is a unique index
indisprimary	bool	 	If true, this index represents the primary key of the\n table (indisunique should always be true when this is true)
indisexclusion	bool	 	If true, this index supports an exclusion\n constraint
indimmediate	bool	 	If true, the uniqueness check is enforced immediately\n on insertion (irrelevant if indisunique is not true)
indisclustered	bool	 	If true, the table was last clustered on this\n index
indisvalid	bool	 	If both this flag and indisready are true, the index is\n currently valid for queries. False means the index is possibly incomplete: it must still be modified by INSERT/UPDATE operations, but it cannot safely be used for queries. If it is unique, the uniqueness property is not guaranteed true either.
indcheckxmin	bool	 	If true, queries must not use the index until the\n xmin of this pg_index row is below their TransactionXmin event horizon, because the table may contain broken HOT chains with incompatible rows that they can see
indisready	bool	 	If true, the index is currently ready for inserts.\n False means the index must be ignored by INSERT/UPDATE operations.
indkey	int2vector	pg_attribute.attnum	This is an array of indnatts values that indicate which\n table columns this index indexes. For example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns make up the index key. A zero in this array indicates that the corresponding index attribute is an expression over the table columns, rather than a simple column reference.
indcollation	oidvector	pg_collation.oid	For each column in the index key, this contains the\n OID of the collation to use for the index.
indclass	oidvector	pg_opclass.oid	For each column in the index key, this contains the\n OID of the operator class to use. See pg_opclass for details.
indoption	int2vector	 	This is an array of indnatts values that store per-column\n flag bits. The meaning of the bits is defined by the index's access method.
indexprs	pg_node_tree	 	Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for\n index attributes that are not simple column references. This is a list with one element for each zero entry in indkey. Null if all index attributes are simple references.
indpred	pg_node_tree	 	Expression tree (in nodeToString() representation) for\n partial index predicate. Null if not a partial index.
